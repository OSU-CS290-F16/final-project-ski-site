		<h2>Mount Ashland</h2>
		<p>With an elevation of 7500 ft Mount Ashland is no Mountain to tamper with. It also has an average snowfall of 265 inches which while being considerably lower than both Hood and Bachelor is still a whole lot of snow! Wow! This mountain, unlike the others, is part of Siskiyou Mountains in Southern Oregon with mount Ashland being the tallest in the range. This Mountain, similar to Mount Bachelor, houses only one notable ski lodge and resort. </p>
